TimeDomain measurement AWG:
  ☐ Check if you need goto_target argument, .\sequence.py:43
  ☐ Check if we can multilply a sine and a Gaussian function by having
  2 waves on in the element on the same channel
  This is not how we should make a Gausian envolope by first adding a sine to the channel
     and hereafter multiplying it with a Gaussian. This is a nogo!

     We should precompile this Gaussian envolope pulse before uploading it to a channel1



  ✔  Test Sequency.py @done (17-05-07 12:48)
  ✔ put everything in correct format for AWG @done (17-05-07 12:48)
  ✔ What's the meaning of a fixed point readout! @done (17-04-25 14:22)
    see documentation.txt
    ✔  Is it correct that one can only load one sequence into the AWG memory @done (17-04-25 15:48)
    True!!!
    Usually when loading of a sequence fails, it means that the waveform memory is overloaded

   ☐ Make timeout function for AWG520 driver: AWG.get_timeout() and get_timeout()
   ✔ write function that checks whether or not AWG is ready @done (17-05-07 12:50)
   ☐ in the future, make AWG configuration file for instrument and channels such that user can set settings through configuration file

   ! Note that in python 3 we need to explicitly state the ASCII encoding of strings etc.
   In python 2 the default encoding is ASCII

   ☐ Need a code where we configure the AWG channels etc
   ✔ make wfm extension for channel waveform files @done (17-05-07 14:20)

    ✔ Tested pulses (wfm files) by uploading it onto the AWG. Uploading was done with ftp. @done (17-05-07 12:52)

   ✔ Read pulses out with Rigol Osciloscope (see picture) and measured time between pulses and all the measured time were more or less (+-5 ns) what we expected @done (17-05-07 12:52)

    ✔ Still need to test sequence files @done (17-05-07 12:52)
    ✔ When sequencing is tested, then we can automate file sending and uploading @done (17-05-09 14:16)
    ✔ Check whats'up with waveform viewing (viewer.py) @done (17-05-07 12:52)
    I checked it again on the computer in my office and seems to be working fine.
   

     ✔ add the end of element files .wfm extension @done (17-05-07 14:21)

     ✔ There was an issue with the naming when a pulse was copied. It used the name of the channel @done (17-05-07 13:41)
        with which the pulse object was initialized with in the first place.
        This issue is resolved by correcting the name variable in the object call method.

      temporarly changed AWG station for testing, undo changes after testing

      ✔ In test function import AWG TEktronix @done (17-05-09 14:17)
      ✔ in AWG station remove init_dir, test_send, and test_send_sequence, datetime importing @done (17-05-09 14:17)
      ✔ In AWG station add is_awg_ready @done (17-05-09 14:17)

      ✔ Later make a seperate directory where AWG files are stored @done (17-05-09 14:17)






Timedomain Measurement FSV:

  ☐ Write basic functions that sets and gets properties to and from instrument
  ☐ Make a modulation pulse and trigger pulse on AWG and test how FSV works
  ☐ Make detector function which communicates with all instruments to actually 
    carry out experiment
