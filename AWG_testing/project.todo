TimeDomain measurement:
  ☐ Check if you need goto_target argument, .\sequence.py:43
  ☐ Check if we can multilply a sine and a Gaussian function by having
     2 waves on in the element on the same channel

  ☐  Test Sequency.py
  ☐ put everything in correct format for AWG
  ✔ What's the meaning of a fixed point readout! @done (17-04-25 14:22)
    see documentation.txt
    ✔  Is it correct that one can only load one sequence into the AWG memory @done (17-04-25 15:48)
    True!!!
    Usually when loading of a sequence fails, it means that the waveform memory is overloaded

   ☐ Make timeout function for AWG520 driver: AWG.get_timeout() and get_timeout()
   ☐ write function that checks whether or not AWG is ready
   ☐ in the future, make AWG configuration file for instrument and channels such that user can set settings through configuration file

   ! Note that in python 3 we need to explicitly state the ASCII encoding of strings etc.
   In python 2 the default encoding is ASCII

   ☐ Need a code where we configure the AWG channels etc
