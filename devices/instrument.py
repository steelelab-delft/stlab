"""Module implementing instrument class

This module is at the center of the instrument control scheme.  Almost all
instrument drivers inherit from this class.  It basically repackages the basic
pyvisa write and query commands and handles the creation of the pyvisa
resource manager.  It also adds some basic reset and id commands common to
all devices that inherit from it

The class can in principle be used directly in measurement scripts but
you will be forced to explicitly write the VISA commands directly.  Most drivers
already include a collection of commands and specific quality of life methods
that allow you to already do basic functions.

    Implements basic read/write/query communication for visa instruments using
    pyvisa and visa backend (usually NI-VISA).  Includes a few extra methods
    that should be common for all instruments.  Keep in mind that these methods
    can always be overridden by children of this class (for example if you always 
    need to include a wait time after querying or an ``'*OPC?'`` after writing).


    Attributes
    ----------
    global_rs : pyvisa.highlevel.ResourceManager
        Visa resource manager used to instantiate each visa instrument.
        This member is static and shared by all instrument objects
    rstype : str
        String that stores the current backend the resource manager is
        using.  Can be '@ni' or '@py' for NI-VISA or pyvisa-py backend.
    dev : pyvisa.resources.Resource
        pyvisa resource that points to the desired device.  Created
        upon instantiation.

        Sets up the instrument using pyvisa and instantiates the resource
        manager if not done yet.  Upon first call it also instantiantes the
        pyvisa ResourceManager for the whole session.  It is single static member

        Parameters
        ----------
        addr : str
            Address of the VISA instrument to be instantiated
        reset : bool, optional
            Will call :any:`reset` on instantiation to reset instrument to default settings.
            If set to False, the user will have to manually confirm three times that the reset is not wanted.
            This will happen once more if the device was instantiated using :code:`stlab.adi`
        verb : bool, optional
            Print strings written to the device on screen
        **kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments to be passed to pyvisa's open_resource method.
            See pyvisa documentation for details.  Examples could be baud_rate,
