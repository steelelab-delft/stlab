"""He7Temperature - Driver to communicate with the custom He7 Temperature server

This driver is NOT based on a VISA instrument.  It only implements a TCP socket via the
standard socket package.  The socket implementation is in stlab.utils.MySocket.
The idea is that the server script is run on the He7 control computer 
while this driver is imported in the measurement script.  The server will, upon request, 
provide the last He3 head temperature from the running log to this driver.  This is because,
typically, the BF and Entropy software blocks direct communication to the Lakeshore controller 
in order to keep the logs running.  Therefore, this driver can NOT do any write operations 
to the temperature controller or fridge.

To do write operations (like temperature control, etc.) use the BFWrapper/BFDaemon
driver/script which works for the old and new BF as well as the He7.
